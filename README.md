# Monumenta Gaming

Inspired by Noelle’s and Provi’s modpack, this one is designed for playing monumenta, a CTMMMORPG minecraft server that I love to play a lot.

    - Contains the music for Overworld, dungeons, strikes, bosses, & towns

    - Shulker box tooltip
    - Advanced Chat
        - Fully set up and ready to go
    - Essential
    - Jade
    - JsMacros (disabled by default due to issues between fancymenu mods & this mod)
    - Inventory HUD+
    - Xaero’s Minimap & WorldMap (with Cave Mode & Entity Rader turned off)
- Monumenta enhancement mods
    - Unofficial monumenta mod
    - Monumenta Item Dictionary
- Many more. Check out the mod list in GitHub
 + = check on monumenta discord for updates, however I probably will update the modpack with resource pack whenever it updated

## Installation:

### Vanilla Launcher:

1. Download this modpack from Modrinth website, it should say .mrpack at the end of file.
2. Find the mrpack file and change file extension to .zip
3. Extract the .zip file using 7zip or something else
4. Once it finished extracted, go inside that folder and copy the content inside that folder
5. Paste it into .minecraft folder. You should find it when you type %appdata% on windows *
* I’m not too sure for Mac, I have never used Mac before

## License:

This modpack is licensed under MIT, which means you’re free to reuse part of this modpack, however the content of this modpack (mods, resource packs, musics, logo, & some other) have different license and not covered by this modpack.

## Notes:

- the Guild tab filter need to be set up with your own guild tag as it currently set for ENEMY guild. To do so, you’ll need to go to Main Menu - Mods - AdvancedChatCore - HUD - Chat Tabs - Configure on Guild - Matches - type in your guild tag. I might plan for add every guild tags to be filter so you don’t have to set up.
- The top bar was showing up, I would recommend hide it by pressing CTRL + Alt + C in Main Menu or any other menu
- It has four node button that you can connect to instead of monumenta if you’re having issue with specific bungee not transferring you

## Known Issue:

- Custom Main Menu doesn’t load the images when you first loaded the modpack. To fix this, go to Setup on top bar - Import - Choose from Saved Setups - Confirm - monumenta-layout - Choose
