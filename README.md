## Notes:

- the Guild tab filter need to be set up with your own guild tag as it currently set for ENEMY guild. To do so, you’ll need to go to Main Menu - Mods - AdvancedChatCore - HUD - Chat Tabs - Configure on Guild - Matches - type in your guild tag. I might plan for add every guild tags to be filter so you don’t have to set up.
- The top bar was showing up, I would recommend hide it by pressing CTRL + Alt + C in Main Menu or any other menu
- It has four node button that you can connect to instead of monumenta if you’re having issue with specific bungee not transferring you

## Known Issue:

- misalignment and miscenter of GUI
